# GRAPH_SYSTEM

A modern C++17 graph library for building, traversing, and analyzing directed or undirected graphs with weighted edges.  
Includes implementations of classic graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, and Johnson’s algorithm.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Directed or undirected graphs (configurable)
- ✅ Weighted edges support
- ✅ Dynamic vertex and edge creation
- ✅ Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- ✅ Depth-First Search (DFS) — iterative and recursive
- ✅ Topological sort (DFS-based and Kahn’s algorithm)
- ✅ Connected components detection (for undirected graphs)
- ✅ Shortest path algorithms:
  - Dijkstra
  - Bellman-Ford (with negative cycle detection)
  - Floyd-Warshall
  - Johnson’s algorithm
